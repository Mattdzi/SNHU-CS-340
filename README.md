8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item Assignment

<b>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? </b>
- Writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is nessacry for long term development and collaboration. Considering my work on the CRUD python module from Project One, one way to achieve code like this is modular code desgin. Being able to break down code into modular compnents will allow for an easier time with organzing and adaptibility to the code. For example, the CRUD module had seperate modules for creatimg, reading, updating, and deleting with made it possible to easy one with ease without affecting the others. Proper comments and documentations will aid the current developer later on in the development or another developer joining in on the development later on. While developing the code, it is also good to have a consistent formatting and sytle as it is easier to read and understand as development continutes. These are a few examples on how to develop code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
<b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b>

<b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b>
